      Welcome to the MWP experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin.

    main: >
      In today's experiment you will answer some simple yes or no questions
      about familiar objects like dogs, chairs, and elephants.


      Think about it like a game you might play with a child who is learning
      about these objects for the first time. First you'll read the question (for
      example, 'Does it have feathers?'), then you'll hear the name of an
      object, like 'eagle' or 'table'.


      Your job is answer the 'yes' or 'no' question as quickly and accurately as
      possible using the keyboard. If the answer is yes, press the up arrow.
      Otherwise, press the down arrow. Answer the question below using the keyboard.
    example: "Does it have feathers? --> eagle"
    advance: up

      Some of the questions may sound a bit weird. If the question doesn't make sense,
      the answer is most likely 'no'. Answer the question below using the keyboard.
    example: "Does it have feathers? --> pineapple"
    advance: down

      Other questions will be true for some items in a category, but not all items.
      In these cases, the answer is 'yes'. An example of one of these questions is
      below. Answer it to continue.
    example: "Is it green? --> apple"
    advance: up
  5:
    tag: word_apple
    main: >
      For some of the questions, instead of reading a question you will see
      some dashes printed on the screen, and then you will hear the name of
      an object. After the name, you will be presented a printed word. On
      these trials, you will answer whether or not the word is the same
      as the named object. If you see the word you just heard through the
      headphones, press the up arrow. If it's a different word, press the down
      arrow.


      Respond to the word below as if you had heard "apple" in the previous
      question.
    example: "raisin"
    advance: down
  6:
    tag: mask
    main: >
      On some trials you will see flashing colorful patterns, like the one below.
      Please remain looking at the computer screen even when the mask is flashing.
      Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

      You are done with the instructions. If you have any questions, let the
      experimenter know. You will begin with some practice trials. Press the
      SPACEBAR when you are ready to begin the practice trials.
timeout: >
  You missed one! Please respond as quickly and accurately as you can. Take a
  moment to rest if you need it. When you are ready to continue, press the
  SPACEBAR.
end_of_practice: >
  You've completed the practice trials. Are you ready to begin the
  next part of the experiment?


  As you figured out in the practice trials, you cannot respond until you see
  the prompt "?" or until you see the printed word. Do not try to
  respond before you see what question you are supposed to answer.


  Finally, please make sure to look at the central "+" while you are
  listening for the named object.


  When you are ready to being, press the SPACEBAR.
break_screen: >
  You've finished one part of the experiment. Take a quick break, but please
  stay in the room. When you are ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR.
end_of_experiment: >
  You've finished the experiment. The next thing for you to do is to complete
  a survey. This survey will appear in a web browser after you press the
  SPACEBAR. If you do not see the survey or have any problems submitting your
  responses, please let the experimenter know. Thank you for participating!
